**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal data is handled in the HiNote extension.

## Data Storage and Transmission

- **We do not transmit your data to any server.** All your data, including your notes and annotations, is stored locally on your computer using your browser's IndexedDB. This means your data is under your control and is not sent to us or any third parties.
- **All data is stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB.** You have full control over your data. If you uninstall the extension, your data will be removed.

## AI Features

- **AI features (Tier 2) communicate directly with OpenAI/Anthropic/Google Gemini only when you explicitly ask.** When you use an AI-powered feature, the relevant data is sent directly to the AI provider's API. We do not act as an intermediary, and we do not see or store this data. Your use of these features is subject to the privacy policies of the respective AI providers.

## Browsing History

- **We do not track your browsing history.** The extension only accesses the content of the current page when you activate it to create or restore a highlight. It does not record or transmit your browsing history.
